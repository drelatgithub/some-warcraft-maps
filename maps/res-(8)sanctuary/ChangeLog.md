# 2.99l

- Remade Xuming for The Elder
    - Now Xuming will extract in total 60 seconds from a unit and kill it when the extraction finishes. The time extracted will keep The Elder from dying when taking more damage than current HP. However, if this time runs out, The Elder dies.
    - Extracts 1s from the unit every 3/2/1 seconds.
    - Cooldown: 120/110/100 seconds.

    - Warden's Blink distance scaled from 1000/1075/1150/3225 to 1000/1200/1400/1600.
